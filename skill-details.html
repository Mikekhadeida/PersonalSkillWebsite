            <p><strong>Skills Details: coding:</strong>
                <p>Algorithms: I use algorithms to find efficient solutions to problems. I practice using sorting, searching, and recursion techniques to improve my coding skills.</p>
                <p>Version Control: I use Git to keep track of changes in my code and collaborate with others. It helps me manage projects and ensures that I can always go back to previous versions if needed.</p>
                <p>Building Projects: I learn by building small projects that focus on solving real-world problems. These projects help me apply what I’ve learned and gain hands-on experience.</p> 
            </p>

            <p><strong> Benefits of coding:</strong>
                <p>Job Opportunities: Coding is in high demand in many industries, including software development, data analysis, and artificial intelligence.</p>
                <p>Problem Solving: Coding teaches you how to approach and solve problems in an organized and logical way.</p>
            </p>
            <p><strong>How I Mastered Coding:</strong></p>
            <p>Practice: I spend time daily writing code to get better at solving problems. The more I code, the more confident I become.</p>
            <p>Online Courses: I’ve taken online courses in programming languages like Java, Html, and C++ to deepen my understanding.</p>
            <p>Projects: I apply my skills to real projects, like creating simple websites, apps, or solving coding challenges on platforms like LeetCode and Codecademy.</p>
