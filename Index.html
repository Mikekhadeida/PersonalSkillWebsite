            <p><strong>Introduction:</strong> 
        Hello, my name is Mike A. Khadeida, and I am currently majoring in Computer Science and Psychology at Brooklyn College, with plans to graduate in 2025.

        I developed a deep passion for coding when I first started my studies at Brooklyn College. Over the years, my interest in computer science has only grown, and I am now considering pursuing a master's degree in engineering. Although I have not yet decided on the specific focus, my goal is to continue expanding my knowledge, diving into new areas of learning, and exploring uncharted territories in the field.

        The Importance of Coding: Coding is an essential skill in today’s world. It not only enables problem-solving in innovative ways but also opens up opportunities in fields ranging from software development to artificial intelligence and data science. Mastering this skill will allow me to contribute meaningfully to technological advancements and tackle real-world challenges.
